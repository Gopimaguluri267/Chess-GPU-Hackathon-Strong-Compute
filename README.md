# Chess-GPU-Hackathon-Strong-Compute

This is the codebase in which we developed a chess bot that combines convolutional neural networks with self-attention and squeeze-excitation blocks. Unlike traditional chess engines relying on reinforcement learning, this approach treats board evaluation as a computer vision problem, processing 8Ã—8 chess boards with piece encoding to produce a scalar position score. Trained on 350,000 Grandmaster games using a 48-GPU cluster, this innovative model won us and my team a $10,000 credit in a hackathon.
